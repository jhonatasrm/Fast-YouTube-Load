YouTube page load is 5x slower in Firefox than in Chrome because YouTube's Polymer redesign relies on the deprecated Shadow DOM v0 API only implemented in Chrome. This extension helps you to load more faster the page in your Firefox.

## Requirements
* Firefox 57.0 or later

## Version
* Currently in the version 1.3
